Healing_Hand.ino is the main program that we are working out of. 
arduino_breakout.ino is the breakout code we are basing our game off of
simple_flex_read.ino is a simple program that works to read the flex AND adafruit force sensors

We still need to integrate singeltact force sensors if possible and get the game working with our hardware
